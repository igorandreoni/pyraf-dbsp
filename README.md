## PYRAF-DBSP
*A PyRAF-based reduction pipeline for spectra taken with the Palomar 200-inch Double Spectrograph.*

This pipeline provides a simplified interface for basic reduction of single-object spectra with minimal overhead.  It is suitable for quicklook classification of transients as well as moderate-precision (few km/s) radial velocity work.

Tested with IRAF 2.16.1, PyRAF 2.1.6.


This version of the pipeline was developed mainly by Zhuyun Zhuang and Kevin Burdge.  The final version of the pipeline `dbsp_new.py` and the
updated documentation were put together during a DBSP data reduction workshop at Caltech in February 2019.  Contributors include: Scott
Adams, Igor Andreoni, Kevin Burdge, Michael Coughlin, Kishalay De, Alison Dugas, Matthew Hankins, Anna Ho, Yuhan Yao, and Zhuang Zhuyun.
